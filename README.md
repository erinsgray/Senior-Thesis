# Senior-Thesis
Rain, Rain, Go Away: Historic Rainfall Analysis in the Baltimore Region.
These are the majority of files edited for the completion of my 2020 Senior Thesis.
A few other working files with more exploratory analyses were not included in this github as the work did not make it into the final thesis.
Initially files were untarred, combined and then analyzed using these files.
Additionally, ARCGis was used to create the basin averaged rain rates which requires both the use of the online
website as well as the actual application - which can be accessed via the Princeton CEE Computer Cluster.
Many of these files were left in working process as there were multiple iterations of testing done for best viewing of the data.
Leaving this code in could be useful for other teams to investigate multiple paths for separate research.
